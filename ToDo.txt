x = complete/satisfactory for now
/ = in progress
- = not started/skipped

To Do
Phase 1 (Movement):
x Movement using A* and taking into account edge cases
x Movement looks cooler (lines and numbers indiciating turn reached)
- Possibility (animate troop movement (basically show path it took instead of tp to dst))
x Unit swapping if both units have movement

Phase 2 (Improve Foundation):
x Rivers and other terrain/obstacles
x More terrains/features (mountains, forests)
/ Improve Graphics

Phase 3 (Visibility and knowledge)
x Fog of War
x Terrain affects vision
x Revealed tiles for each player (basically undiscovered tiles)
x Account for unrevealed tiles when attempting to traverse

Phase 4 (Combat Implementation):
x Zone of Control
x Basic attack implementation for melee and ranged
x Unit can only attack enemies it can see
x Combat strength calculations (terrain, health, etc.)
x UI for displaying combat info
- Unit Flanking (Prob something that will come later)
x Complete unit options (fortify, skip turn) excluding attacks
- Add more unit types
/ Indicate which units have movement and not completed action. (Unit cycling)
/ Implement unit graphics/art



Phase 5 (General Cleanup and Foundations)
/ GameState
/ Clean Unit code as it is not scalable and getting quite messy
- Win Screen/Reset


Phase 6 (AI):
/ Implement Basic Rule/Score based AI
/ AI movement
/ AI attack
/ Secondary Actions
- Multi-Threading
- Investigate and Implement ML techniques
- AI v AI
/ Player v AI
- ML implementation vs Score based implementation

Phase 7 (Improving Combat (Not priority)):
- Implement visuals for combat to better display which unit is attacking what
- Visuals for indiciating if a unit has movement/actions or not
- Visuals for units that are fortified

Phase 7.5 (Flesh out):
- Randomize terrain/map
- Difficulty modifiers?
- Clean up code (particularly draw_map)
- Right click support
- UX for movement and attack. Possibly combine both.
