x = complete/satisfactory for now
/ = in progress
- = not started/skipped

To Do
Phase 1 (Movement):
x Movement using A* and taking into account edge cases
x Movement looks cooler (lines and numbers indiciating turn reached)
- Possibility (animate troop unit (basically show path it took instead of tp to dst))
x Unit swapping if both units have movement

Phase 2 (Improve Foundation):
x Rivers and other terrain/obstacles
x More terrains/features (mountains, forests)
/ Improve Graphics

Phase 5 (Visibility and knowledge)
x Fog of War
x Terrain affects vision
x Revealed tiles for each player (basically undiscovered tiles)
x Account for unrevealed tiles when attempting to traverse

Phase 3 (Combat Implementation):
x Zone of Control
x Basic attack implementation for melee and ranged
x Unit can only attack enemies it can see
/ Combat strength calculations (terrain, health, etc.)
- UI for displaying combat
- Complete unit options (fortify, skip turn) excluding attacks
- Add more unit types

Phase 5 (AI):
- Implement AI
- AI v AI
- Player v AI

Phase 6 (Flesh out):
- Randomize terrain/map
- Difficulty modifiers?
- Clean up code (particularly draw_map)
- Right click support
- UX for movement and attack. Possibly combine both.
